// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

// import 'package:proc_dealer/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('placeholder', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // App widget test intentionally disabled; main structure does not use MyApp.
    expect(true, isTrue);
  });
