# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainer or use GitHub's private reporting if enabled. Provide:

- A clear description and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- A minimal proof of concept if possible

We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and provide an ETA after triage.
